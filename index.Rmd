## Catch up

- Any questions on material from last time?

- Any questions on the reading / primer?

## Agenda

.pull-left[

- Functions

- Environments

- Vectors

Full disclosure: 

- These topics are extremely important. 

- They may also seem boring and useless at first. 

- Stay vigilant!

# Functions

---

## What is a function?

A function starts with inputs, applies a process, and returns an output.

- Functions are everywhere. Do you recognize this one? 

    + inputs: eggs, chocolate chips, flour, sugar and butter
    
    + process: preheat oven, mix ingredients, bake, let cool.
    
    + outputs: 12 cookies
    
---

## What is a function?

In R, the function output is usually assigned to a new variable, e.g.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

cookie_batch <- make_cookies(batch_size = 12)

```

A command like this would create a new object in my global environment that can be accessed in subsequent commands.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

byron <- add_food(to = byron, what = cookie_batch)

```

Note how the object `byron` is modified by the line of code above, and the output is also called `byron`. Is this syntax confusing? It usually takes some getting used to. 


---

## What is an environment?

R stores objects in environments (think of these like containers). 

- Your workspace is the `global environment`. This is where objects are stored by default:

```{r}

x <- 1:5

```

- Dataframes and lists create their own environments: 

```{r}
df <- tibble(x = c('a','b','c','d','e'))
```

After running these two lines of code, what do you think R will do if we ask it to print `x`?

--

```{r}
x
```

So then how do we access `x` inside of the dataframe we made??

```{r}
df$x
```

# Vectors

---
## Atomic vectors


- A lot of the analysis we do in R can be boiled down to atomic vectors, these are

    + logical: `TRUE`, `FALSE`
    
    + integer: ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...
    
    + double: 1, 1.23, 5.0001, etc.
    
    + character: "a", "any string", "1", etc.


To create an atomic vector manually, use the `c()` function, short for combine, concatenate, and coerce, depending on how it is used. 

```{r}

# Atomic vector examples -- # full name - abbreviation
lgl_var <- c(TRUE, FALSE)   # logical   = lgl
int_var <- c(1L, 6L, 10L)   # integer   = int
dbl_var <- c(1, 2.5, 4.5)   # double    = dbl
chr_var <- c("a", "b", "c") # character = chr

```

---

## Logical vectors

- Logical values must be either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. 

- R evaluates logical values with operations similar to numeric values, but with some additional symbols that allow you to engage with logical structures.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '90%'}

knitr::include_graphics("img/transform-logical.png")

```

---

## Logical vectors

```{r}
x <- TRUE; y <- FALSE

# either is true
x | y

```


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '90%'}

knitr::include_graphics("img/transform-logical.png")

```

---

## Logical vectors

```{r}
x <- TRUE; y <- FALSE

# both are true
x & y

```


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '90%'}

knitr::include_graphics("img/transform-logical.png")

```

---

## Logical vectors

```{r}
x <- TRUE; y <- FALSE

# exactly one is true
xor(x, y)

```


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '90%'}

knitr::include_graphics("img/transform-logical.png")

```

---

## Integer and double vectors

- These two types are collectively called `numeric` vectors. 

- logicals are coerced into `integer` types, which in turn are coerced to `double`, when these types are combined:

```{r}

c(TRUE, FALSE, 2L, pi)

```


---

## Character vectors

Character values in R represent strings

- surrounded by `"` (`"hi"`) or `'` (`'bye'`). 

- You can create strings with either  single quotes or double quotes.

- I recommend always using `"` to create strings and then using `'` if you have a quote inside of your string.

```{r}

string1 <- "a string"
string1

```


```{r}

string2 <- "a 'string' value"
string2

```

---

## Indexing vectors

Data from vectors can be subset using square brackets: `[]`

```{r}

x <- c(0, 5, 10)

x[1]

x[c(2,3)]

```


---

## Indexing vectors

Logical values can also be used to subset vectors:

```{r}

x[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)] # same as x[1]

x[c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)] # same as x[c(2,3)]

```

---

## Indexing vectors

Combining logical expressions with indexing is a nice trick:

```{r}

x[x < 5] # returns all values of x < 5

x[x >= 5] # returns all values of x >= 5

```

---

## Summarizing vectors

- `mean()`, `median()`, `min()`, `max()`, `sum()`,  and `table()` are all useful summary functions for vectors. 

- `mean` and `sum` in particular can be useful for computing proportions and counts of `TRUE` conditions, for example:

```{r}

# the number of x values greater than 0
sum(x > 0)

# the proportion of x values greater than 0
mean(x > 0)

```

## Your turn

- Switch to Rstudio cloud and find the data visualization basics project. 

- Work on completing the problems in `exercises.Rmd` with your teammates.
